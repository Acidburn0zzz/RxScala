TODOs for Scala Adapter
-----------------------

This is a (probably incomplete) list of what still needs to be done in the Scala adaptor:

*    integrating Scala Futures, should there be a common base interface for Futures and Observables?
*    Add methods present in Scala collections library, but not in RxJava, e.g. aggregate Ã  la Scala, collect, exists, tails, ...
*    combineLatest with arities > 2
*    Avoid text duplication in scaladoc using templates, add examples, distinction between use case signature and full signature
*    other small TODOs
